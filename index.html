    Hi, I'm Alex Kim.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a programmer with roots in philosophy. I'm most interested in <b>minds</b>, <b>computers</b>, and <b>education</b>. All of which contribute to questions about why we experience the world as we do and how our environments, tools, and ideas shape and extend us. Here you'll find pages for my notes, projects, and essays.
