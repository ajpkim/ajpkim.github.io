    Hi, I'm Alex Kim.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a software engineer who started out in philosophy. I'm interested in minds, computers, and questions related to how we experience and model the world. I like to think about how our environments, tools and ideas shape and extend us. Here you'll find pages for my notes, projects, and essays.
